# WordPress & Docker

The purpose of this project was to create a WordPress page with Nginx, PHP-FPM, and MySQL, and deploy the website using Docker Compose. 

## About the Wordpress page

This WordPress page uses the EverParks theme. Additionally, the page utilizes the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to add text to news posts. The page uses WordPress's wp_nav_menu() function to create and manage dynamic menus in WordPress admin panel. The EverParks theme is built with Bootstrap 5 to make responsive web design easier.
